/*
 * pgxc_FQS_planner
 * The routine tries to see if the statement can be completely evaluated on the
 * Datanodes. In such cases Coordinator is not needed to evaluate the statement,
 * and just acts as a proxy. A statement can be completely shipped to the remote
 * node if every row of the result can be evaluated on a single Datanode.
 * For example:
 *
 * 1. SELECT * FROM tab1; where tab1 is a distributed table - Every row of the
 * result set can be evaluated at a single Datanode. Hence this statement is
 * completely shippable even though many Datanodes are involved in evaluating
 * complete result set. In such case Coordinator will be able to gather rows
 * arisign from individual Datanodes and proxy the result to the client.
 *
 * 2. SELECT count(*) FROM tab1; where tab1 is a distributed table - there is
 * only one row in the result but it needs input from all the Datanodes. Hence
 * this is not completely shippable.
 *
 * 3. SELECT count(*) FROM tab1; where tab1 is replicated table - since result
 * can be obtained from a single Datanode, this is a completely shippable
 * statement.
 *
 * fqs in the name of function is acronym for fast query shipping.
